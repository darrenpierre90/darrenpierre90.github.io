I have a strong interest in AI, Machine Learning and Data Science. This passion may lead me to pursue a master\u2019s in one of these 3 topics in the future. I would like to see myself as a life long learner who doesn\u2019t just have great technical skills but great communication skills also .Ideally I would like a hybrid role where I get to create something but also get to interact with others. But in general I enjoy any role that allows me to participate in a meaningful way so that I'm in service of the team/organisations .
